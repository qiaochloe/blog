# Changing the modification date

1. In the folder ~/Library/Containers/com.culturedcode.ThingsMac/Data/Library/Application Support/Cultured Code/, create a folder called "Things Scripts"
2. In the "Things Scripts" folder, create a file called "Change-Modification Date.scpt" with the following content:

```applescript
tell application "Things3"
	set theToDos to selected to dos

	if theToDos is {} then
		display alert "No to dos selected"
	else
		display dialog "Yesterday?" with title "Date Completed" default answer short date string of ((current date) - (1 * days))

		set theCompletionDate to (text returned of result)

		repeat with theToDo in theToDos
			set status of theToDo to open
			set completion date of theToDo to date theCompletionDate
		end repeat
	end if

end tell
```

This script might not work if you set the date to a future date. You'll have to delete the to-do and recreate it.

3. Set a custom shortcut for the script
1. Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts > +
1. Select Things from the Application dropdown and type the exact name of the script in the Menu Title box.
1. Set the shortcut. I use `Cmd-Y` for "Yesterday".
