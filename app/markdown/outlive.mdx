## From fast death to slow death

   Medicine has focused mostly on fast death (accidents, injuries, infection) and not slow death from aging. The Four Horsemen are: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and type 2 diabetes and metabolic dysfunction.

   Not only should we think about how long we live (lifespan), we must also think about how well we live (healthspan).

   Dealing with slow death requires early preventive measures. The difference between prediabetic (137 mg/dL blood glucose) and Type 2 diabetes (140 mg/dL) is just 3 points. Prediabetics are usually under "annual monitoring," while diabetics are given extensive treatment. But "normal" is more like 100 mg/dL, so prediabetes is already pretty late in the game. 

## Rethinking medicine for the age of chronic disease

   Medicine 1.0 began when people realized that diseases were caused by nature and not the actions of gods. Its conclusions were based on observation and guesswork.

   Medicine 2.0 arrived in the mid-1800s with the germ theory of disease. It was prompted by the scientific method way of thinking. While it is great at creating new antibiotics and sanitary practices, it is not very successful against the Horsemen.

   Medicine 3.0 should emphasize preventive, personalized, risk-adjusted care. It should also focus more on healthspan than in the past.

## A road map for reading this book

   Medicine 2.0 has two tactics: procedures (surgery) and medications.

   Medicine 3.0 should have more domains: exercise, nutrition, sleep, emotional health, and exogenous molecules (drugs, hormones, or supplements).

   Hard to study longevity with randomized controlled trials (RCT). Instead we can look at different sources of data: centenarians, animal models, human studies of the Horsemen, molecular and cellular science, and Mendelian randomization (MR). 

   MR is able to find causal relationships between risk factors and outcomes in situations where it is hard to do RCT. It does this by considering random variation in genes and comparing them to the observed results. This eliminates many of the biases in pure epidemiology.

## The older you get, the healthier you have been

   Lots of centenarians have bad habits. There probably isn't a shared genetic bases for their longevity either, since natural selection doesn't necessarily favor longer lifespans.

   APOE affects cholesterol and glucose metabolism, and it is linked to delaying (or not delaying) Alzheimer's disease. 

   FOXO3 governs gene expression. Some variants of FOXO3 is also associated with longevity. Although we cannot change our genotypes, we can affect our phenotypes (gene expression) through our environment and behaviors.
