It's summer! 

## Letting (as opposed to 'subletting')

I'm leasing an apartment with my friends [Aren](https://arenguralp.com/) and Jason. We'll also have Alex W around over the summer (affectionately "the W" or "the Engineer"). This is actually the group of people I spent last summer with (see [summer 2024](/summer-2024-now)), so I'm super excited. My goals are to cook & host every weekend.

## Puzzle Club

[bph-site](https://github.com/brown-puzzle-hq/bph-site) is the open-source site we run [Puzzlethon](https://puzzlethon.brownpuzzle.club/) and [BPH 2025](https://www.brownpuzzlehunt.com/) on. There's a lot of good summer development to be done, now that I have the time and brain space for it.

## Employment

I am gainfully employed this summer. Yes! 

I will be working as a SPOC (Systems Programmer, Operator, and Consultant) for my dear department's TStaff.

## Future Employment


I have found work in the CS Department to be meaningful. It has brought me a great deal of happiness and fulfillment. 

But I cannot escape the fact that... I am about to graduate. I need to find some other form of meaningful employment *soon*, or I really will go crazy out in the real world.

So there's that.
