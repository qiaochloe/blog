It's summer!

## Letting (as opposed to 'subletting')

I'm leasing an apartment with my friends [Aren](https://arenguralp.com/) and Jason. We'll also have Alex W around over the summer (affectionately "the W" or "the Engineer"). This is actually the group of people I spent last summer with (see [summer 2024](/summer-2024-now)), so I'm super excited. My goals are to cook & host every weekend!

## Courses

I have been reflecting a bit about how much information I am actually retaining from my coursework. I gave myself this thought experiment: If I had to TA a course, how well would I do?

This is my self-assessment:

|                        Good                         | Passable                                             | Terrible                                               |
| :-------------------------------------------------: | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| <span style={{ color: "#df5d39" }}>CSCI 0190</span> | <span style={{ color:"#df5d39" }}>CSCI 1450</span>   | <span style={{ color:"#df5d39" }}>COST 0120\*\*</span> |

| <span style={{ color: "#3183af" }}>CSCI 1515</span> |                                                      | <span style={{ color:"#ff9200"}}>COST 0800\*\*</span>  |
|                                                     |                                                      | <span style={{ color:"#678c5a"}}>CSCI 2952R\*\*</span> |
|                                                     |                                                      | <span style={{ color:"#678c5a"}}>MATH 1530</span>      |
|                                                     |                                                      | <span style={{ color:"#3183af"}}>EGYT 1320\*\*</span>  |

  \*If I didn't have to do labs, I think I could bump this up into the "good"
  category

<span style={{ fontSize: "0.75em" }}>
  \*\*Practically speaking, I think you would have to be a proper graduate

  measurement...
</span>

It seems like my <span style={{ color: "#df5d39" }}>freshman fall</span> and <span style={{ color: "#3183af" }}>sophomore spring</span> went alright, but I've mostly forgotten everything from my <span style={{ color: "#ff9200" }}>freshman spring</span> and my <span style={{ color: "#678c5a" }}>sophomore fall</span>. It also seems like this is related to the number of courses I took. In semesters that I took 4-4.5 instead of 5 courses, I retained more from all of them. (The sample size is, of course, n=4.)

But in general, the results... are better than I expected. I remember good amount about the subjects I care a lot about. I'm making a commitment this summer to review CSCI 1680, CSCI 1515, and CSCI 1450 again.

As for next semester, this is what I have in mind:

1. Digital Electronics Systems Design (ENGN 1630)
2. Software Security and Exploitation (CSCI 1650)
3. Topics in Programming Languages (CSCI 1951Q)
4. Sustainable Design in the Built Environment (ENVS 1400)
5. Diversity of Life (BIOL 0210)

I fully expect this to change. CSCI 1951Q is a new course, so I'll shop it and see how it goes. I'd love to fit Computer Graphics (CSCI 1230) in there somehow. I have to take a theory course at some point (500, 1570, or 1010), so this might as well be the semester.

## Puzzle Club

[bph-site](https://github.com/brown-puzzle-hq/bph-site) is the open-source site we run [Puzzlethon](https://puzzlethon.brownpuzzle.club/) and [BPH 2025](https://www.brownpuzzlehunt.com/) on. There's a lot of good summer development to be done, now that I have the time and brain space for it.

## Employment

I am gainfully employed this summer. Yes!

I will be working as a SPOC (Systems Programmer, Operator, and Consultant) for my dear department's TStaff.

## Future Employment

I have found work in the CS Department to be meaningful. It has brought me a great deal of happiness and fulfillment.

But I cannot escape the fact that... I am about to graduate. I need to find some other form of meaningful employment _soon_, or I really will go crazy out in the real world.

So there's that.
