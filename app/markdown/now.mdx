*Updated 3/22/25.*

Wow, I am almost halfway through college. After the stress of shopping period, it has been a very quiet semester so far. I think I have settled into the rhythm of college, and I am not trying anything new. It feels that I now have more time to delve deeper into the things I care about.

## Courses

I am taking 4.5 courses this semester:
1. CSCI 1670/1690: Operating Systems with Lab
2. CSCI 1515: Cryptography
3. ENGN 0520: Circuits and Signals
4. EGYT 1320: Middle Egyptian II

CSCI 1515, ENGN 0520, and EGYT 1320 lectures are excellent, and I can wholeheartedly recommend taking a course with these professors. I am quite busy during the week, so I have to reserve Saturdays for operating systems, or else it won't get done.

My ongoing evaluation is on the [courses](/courses) page.

## CSCI 0300 TA

I love TAing for CSCI 0300 ("Fundamentals of Computer Systems"). I want to write about it someday, but I think that TAing is one of the most fulfilling experiences you can have as an undergraduate at Brown. Highly recommend.

## Sunlab Consultant

We cleaned up the Sunlab recently! Found Andy van Dam's (physical) lecture slides inside this projector.

## CS DUG

We're also bringing back the CS Senior Yearbook this year! If you are a graduating senior at Brown and want a yearbook, you can fill out this form [here](https://forms.gle/iWzmAPFQNE4WJdCE8).

## Puzzle Club

After the hecticness of last semester, progress on the Puzzle Club site has been fairly steady. Most of the infrasture is in place, so we're all working on postprodding the puzzles, adding on the art, and improving the performance.

If you are looking for something cool to do in April, registration for the 2025 Brown Puzzle Hunt is open now on [https://www.brownpuzzlehunt.com/](https://www.brownpuzzlehunt.com/)!

## Dance Dance Revolution

My friend shipped his DDR pad to campus, and I bought a projector for it. Wish I had more time to play on itâ€”I have been using the projector more often to watch lectures.

For last semester, see the [postmortem](/fall-2024-postmortem).
