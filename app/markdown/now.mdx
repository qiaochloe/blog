Wow, I am almost halfway through college. After the stress of shopping period, it has been a very quiet semester so far. I think I have settled into the rhythm of college, and I am not trying anything new. It feels that I now have more time to delve deeper into the things I care about.

## Courses

I am taking 4.5 courses this semester:
1. CSCI 1670/1690: Operating Systems with Lab
2. CSCI 1515: Cryptography
3. ENGN 0520: Circuits and Signals
4. EGYT 1320: Middle Egyptian II

CSCI 1515, ENGN 0520, and EGYT 1320 lectures are excellent, and I can wholeheartedly recommend taking a course with these professors. I am quite busy during the week, so I have to reserve Saturdays for operating systems, or else it won't get done.

## CSCI 0300 TA

I love TAing for CSCI 0300 ("Fundamentals of Computer Systems"). I want to write about it someday, but I think that TAing is one of the most fulfilling experiences you can have as an undergraduate at Brown. Highly recommend.

## Sunlab Consultant

We're cleaning up the Sunlab soon! Stay tuned.

## CS DUG

Many plans brewing. I can't say, but I am super excited.

## Puzzle Club

After the hecticness of last semester, progress on the Puzzle Club site has been fairly steady. I am no longer working 20+ hours a week on the site. I feel that my effectiveness is greatly hindered by my complete lack of understanding of CSS, but what can you do...

## Dance Dance Revolution

My friend shipped a nice DDR pad to campus! We're currently playing on a laptop screen, but I'm planning on getting a projector.

For last semester, see the [postmortem](/fall-2024-postmortem).
