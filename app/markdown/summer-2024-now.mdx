## Subletting

There is a big difference between living in the dorms and having an apartment. Having your own apartment means: living with many of your close friends, cooking your own food, washing your own dishes, hosting dinner parties, and inviting friends over for the night.

It's wonderful. I am very much looking forward to having my own apartment after college.

## Work

Under a UTRA grant, I have been working at the Brown Language and Thought Lab for the summer. It involves recruiting, running clinical trials, and organizing the lab databases. I find that I quite like being in an office, and probably would not mind corporate work. But my commute is pretty awesome—it is roughly a two-minute walk. Research is quite cool to see up close, but it is not for me.

I have also started some course development work for CSCI 1951x! We want to make some improvements to the course autograder, which is written in Lean. Currently it does some type-checking and `sorry`-checking, but it definitely could be extended. Some good Lean references I have been reading are [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Logical Verification](https://browncs1951x.github.io/static/files/hitchhikersguide.pdf), [Metaprogramming in Lean 4](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean4-metaprogramming-book/), and [Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/).

In my free time I have been doing an excessive amount of LeetCode problems. It is addictive, especially when you do it with friends. I should probably stop at some point.

## Idleness and Slack

This summer, I have been

1. [Painting](../art)
2. Bouldering
3. Writing for this site
4. Convincing people to write for their own sites
5. Playing Wingspan
6. Doing Dance Dance Revolution
7. Memorizing the [197 countries of the world](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/world), the [U.S. state capitals](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/uscapitals), and the [U.S. presidents](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/presidents)
8. Editing my vim configuration

## Next Semester

I'll be in my sophomore year of college next semester! Here are some things I'm thinking about:

### Art

I am currently in the middle of several probjects, but I would like to continue this hobby in the school year. If you are a close friend in the Providence area, I am happy to organize an art night with you!

### Bouldering

One of my New Year's Resolutions was to 'send a V4. I landed my first V3 on 7/5/24 and my first V4 on 7/14/24. Let's see if this is repeatable...

### Courses

I plan to take "Computer Networks" (CSCI 1680) one of "Compilers and Program Analysis" (CSCI 1260), "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" (CSCI 1570), "Theory of Computation" (CSCI 1010), and "Programming Languages" (CSCI 1730), and two other for-fun courses. I am prioritizing doing Networks in Rust, so I have to be careful about my course load.

### CS DUG

Cooking something up, please stay tuned.

### Sunlab Consultant

Last semester I spent almost all of my time studing in the Sunlab in the CIT. Next semester, I will be there again—working as a Sunlab consultant.

### CSCI 1951x TA

I will be TA'ing for Formal Proof and Verification in Fall 2024! This will be my first time TA'ing a course, so I'm a little bit nervous.
