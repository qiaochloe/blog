I think it's incredibly important to pay attention to what you consume on the internet.[^1] This is a list of people who inspire me. When I read their work, most of the time I'm thinking, *"huh i can't believe that's possible."* 

- [Ben Kuhn](https://www.benkuhn.net) writes about computer science and improving the world. Plus he was the final impetus for me to start a [blog](https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/). I'll also link his [blogroll](https://www.benkuhn.net/blogroll/). Some of my recommendations might overlap with his.
- [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca) has a ton of great technical posts, and I found her [zines](https://wizardzines.com) really awesome for breaking down intimidating terminal and networking topics. 
- [Chris Krycho](https://v4.chriskrycho.com/) writes about theology, philosophy, and software. His posts are diverse and thoughtful, and I hope that I can make make my blog as methodical and well-organized as his. 
- [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/index.html) is one of the founders of Y Combinator, so you know he's an old hand at building startups. He also has a lot of great ideas about generating opinions and seeking success. As part of my ongoing crusade to convince my readers to start blogs of their own, I'll link his advice on writing [simply](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html) and [usefully](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html).
- [Derek Silvers](https://sive.rs/) is a great writer with a lot of intereseting projects. I particularly like his [book notes](https://sive.rs/book) and his [now page](https://sive.rs/now). 
- [Alex Zhang](https://www.alexyzhang.dev) was my old math club president, but he writes a lot about cybersecurity these days. 
- [Dennis Chen](https://dennisc.net) writes about running math tournaments and creating puzzles. 
- Despite being affiliated with the university, I found the [MIT Admissions Blog](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/) to be refreshingly honest. The questions and feelings that haunt them will probably haunt me too. Read it to know what smart, introspective young people are thinking about these days.
