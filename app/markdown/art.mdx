## Summer 2023

The art studio near me closed during quarantine, so I stopped painting in high school. This goose was the first painting I did in quite a while. I was referencing "[seeking the great goot](https://x.com/MegZavala/status/1484035057656369152)," which was my friend's profile picture at the time.

I painted this flower and vase during an art picnic with my friends. I was trying to mimic "[Reflections in Blue](https://www.karenwernerart.com/portfolio-viewer?collection=113310#lg=1&artworkId=5250360)," which I thought was a fantastic still-life painting.

This fish painting was a recreation of the first pencil drawing I ever made at the art studio, back in 2014. Very nostalgic.

## Fall 2023

I didn't have a lot of time to paint during the school year, but I did manage to make some prints at the Brown Design Workshop.

This checkers set was meant to be a gift for my friend's birthday, but the edges turned out a little uneven. I ended up keeping it for myself.

I did end up gifting this penguin painting to a friend. The little penguin was his favorite bird in Wingspan, a board game we liked to play together. The bug on the left was a recreation of a painting I saw when I went to the Field Museum in Chicago.

## Summer 2024

This was a painting for my parents. I struggled a lot with the stems, since none of my brushes were small enough to make the thin lines I wanted.

This was a painting for my grandparents. I also struggled a bit with the stems here, but I think the colors turned out well.
